I have thought long and hard about this topic. So much so that it has been cooking in the back of my mind for, quite literally, the past four years. I’ve had many experiences with it. Now, on the fourth anniversary of this idea becoming prominent in my head, I believe I have developed a logical enough view that I am ready to present it in words.

Buckle up; it’s time to learn why high school parties are, in my belief, *immeasurably stupid* beyond all comparison.

# **My Thought Process**

To truly understand my viewpoint, you must first understand why I hold such views. Then, I will detail why I hold those views.

I come from a background where the importance of academics is stressed. Performance in school and in personal pursuits is held paramount. Now, this doesn’t mean you weren't encouraged to be a well-rounded person—quite the opposite actually—and I will talk more about this later.

But what this does mean is that trivial pursuits that yield diminishing returns were frowned upon. That’s where the basis of my belief comes from. This is the foundation upon which my thoughts are built.

I believe that high school parties, college parties, and alcohol-driven party culture as a whole are useless for five principal reasons:

1. You can have fun without it.  
2. It harms your personal self-image and social branding.  
3. It harms the relationships of those who choose against it.  
4. It is unhealthy and unsustainable.  
5. It serves little purpose.

I will go through these points one by one, and hopefully, by the end, you at least see where I come from—and if you choose to change your habits, that’s all the better.

This serves as my cathartic release of all the frustration built up from parties I have seen people attend over the past four years of my high school career.

Buckle up.

# **You Can Have Fun Without Alcohol**

Yes, this is the one that most people will push back on. It’s also the point I have least developed and is probably my weakest one, which is why I have placed it first.

Hear me out.

While I have never once in my life consumed ethyl alcohol, nor do I plan to, I have had experiences that are far beyond whatever I hear my friends talk about while under the influence.

Some of the best experiences in my life have been with my friends in dumb situations that we know are dumb, and we can revel in the idea that we are still doing it. Some that come to mind are just playing *Cards Against Humanity* or *The Game of Life* in a friend’s basement. We know we aren’t the target audience of those games, and that’s what makes it so fun. We live in the stupidity of it all.

Perhaps that’s why others find drinking and partying so fun—because they know it’s stupid and continue to do it anyway. Perhaps this is the point that gets used against me because I’m actually arguing for it.

But what I believe is that you can absolutely have an equal amount of, if not more, fun with your friends while completely sober and in control of your faculties.

If you still don’t believe me, here is a list of things I have done with my friends while completely sober that I would consider more fun than partying:

* Going to Six Flags  
* Going to the beach  
* Going out to dinner  
* Playing card games  
* Working out  
* Gossiping

Try them sometime\!

# **Alcohol Harms Your Personal Self-Image and Social Branding**

I feel like I should start this section by defining some terms.

*Self-image* is the way you view yourself as a person. It’s your whole top-down, birds-eye view of your life as a whole and how you stand in it.

*Social branding* is very similar to self-image, except that it deals with how others see you as a person. It’s their whole top-down, birds-eye view of your life and how you stand within it.

So now that we know what we are talking about, how does partying affect all of this?  
Well, there is a social construct that party culture is frowned upon and bad for your self-image. Obviously, there are two important things to remember when it comes to this construct:

1. It becomes less frowned upon the older you get.  
2. Recognizing how high school partying impacts self-image and social branding takes a level of maturity that doesn’t always come easily, especially when it’s our own peers involved.

But as it stands for the target demographic that I am addressing, this construct is still there and still very much applies, which is why I write this section.

Let me tell you, it is not a good look when I go onto your Instagram or TikTok, and I see you in questionable situations holding a can of White Claw in your hand.

I think most people would agree that this is not how they would want to present themselves in professional contexts, yet they still do it anyway\! It baffles my mind because they willingly post these things, fully aware they are actively harming the way they portray themselves, simply for the diminishing return of trying to fit into a social construct that portrays them as "hip" and "jive" and fitting in with everyone. A social construct that was literally propagated by stereotypes found in Hollywood.

Not to mention the fact that it is illegal for the demographic this social construct most applies to. People full well know it’s illegal (and I understand that this is part of the draw—the riskiness and illegality of it all), yet still choose to partake, and then go on to post it on social media\! Have people never been taught the concept of a digital footprint? Do people realize that the internet never forgets, let alone the minds of friends it affects the most? Do people realize how they portray themselves online?

It certainly seems like the answer to all of those questions is a resounding no\!

Then, people make it worse by acquiring fake IDs to get the alcohol needed to fuel these useless parties. What’s worse than one crime? Committing a felony to partake in a crime\!

You see when I spell it all out like this, it sounds silly that people would even consider doing it, but this is actual, real life. You can’t make this stuff up because everyone around you is doing it. It’s real\!

I beg of you to consider the legal and mental implications of portraying yourself this way.

Because I certainly don’t like to be found around criminals.

# **It Harms the Relationships of Those Who Choose Not to Partake**

This one hits especially close to home for me.

Many of the people I choose to surround myself with are genuinely good people 95% of the time they aren’t partying. But that 5% of the time they are, I cannot bear to be around them.

This is partially my fault that I am isolated from them because they chose to make a mistake. But, in the long run, I feel that it’s the best decision for my psyche.

However, I feel that they still need to consider these implications for those who choose not to partake before engaging in such questionable activities.

Partying is meant to be social. That’s the whole point. It’s teenager social hour while trying to act like adults, yet failing at both. For such a social activity, though, it really does leave a lot of people out.

But the people who are left out usually do actually outnumber those who are invited. Think about it, everyone at that party is the entire population who chose to partake. Now consider that population in the context of your entire social circle. Seems small now, right?

The problem lies in the fact that those who were left out are usually not as vocal about it and aren’t going around posting stories bragging about how fun their night was while not at that big party.

It’s a byproduct of the type of people who choose not to go.

It’s a classic case of the silent majority being oppressed.

Nobody wants to be an oppressor.

# **It Is Unhealthy and Unsustainable**

I’ll address each topic in this section individually.

First off, how unhealthy it is.

Alcohol is poison.

It’s true. This is a fact of life.

You see, when I put it that way, people are way more reluctant to discuss it because they don’t like confronting the reality that is there.

But it’s still a reality.

Alcohol overconsumption is still a serious problem today. This is especially prevalent in Greek Life culture, but that’s a story for a different day.

I constantly hear of people getting actual liver damage, cancer, or worse, dying because of their alcohol consumption in high school and college.

It’s a hard reality to confront, but it's the reality we live in.

People also, in their impaired state of mind, make inherently stupid decisions. They say something they shouldn’t. They touch something they shouldn’t. They become overconfident. This overconfidence leads them to think they can do things like drive home safely. Which we all know they can’t, and leads to things like drunk driving-related accidents.

According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/adolescent-health.htm) and [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1017959/distribution-of-the-10-leading-causes-of-death-among-teenagers/), the leading cause of death for teens is unintentional causes (AKA accidents), followed only by assault and suicide—three of my least favorite things\!

In addition, the percentage of adolescents ages 12–17 years who used alcohol in the past month was 9.4% in 2019, which is way higher than it should be.

It’s also unsustainable.

I’ve seen people on TikTok (which I’ll admit is not the most accurate source by any stretch of the imagination but can still be used to pick out social trends) who talk about going to colleges like Alabama or FSU simply because of the party and Greek life scene. By junior or senior year, they get tired of going out every night and suddenly have to face the impending reality they’ve been pushing off for the past couple of years: they’re there for a degree, not to party every night.

It happens to the best of them, and it’s why I wish “party colleges” were never a thing.

Those who do continue often end up with no job, liver damage, and, in the worst cases, an addiction to alcohol and partying.

It never ends well.

Take a step back and plan out your life, please.

The planners are the ones who go far.

# **It Serves Little to No Purpose**

Genuine question: what do you hope to get out of these parties?

Most of the time, people respond with something along the lines of, “Oh, just a good time with my friends.”

Beyond that? They’ve got nothing.

This is what I mean by diminishing returns. From what I hear, you’re just standing around in someone else’s basement (which, last time I checked, you don’t hold the mortgage or deed to), mingling with your friends while people in one corner make out, and in the other corner, they throw up.

You aren’t getting as much out of it as you think you are, especially with all that you’re putting on the line to get these “fun” experiences with your friends (see literally every other point I made).

So what if you have a “wild” memory? So what if “last night was a movie”? You can’t even remember it half the time because you got so blackout drunk that you passed out.

This is why I get so riled up over it. This is why I hold these opinions so passionately. I feel like if more people simply tried to have a good time without partying, they’d be surprised.

The real memories that you’ll actually remember are the ones you make with genuine friends, having a genuinely good time. There’s no need for fermented, poisonous grape juice to play any role in it.

# **Conclusion**

If we, as a culture, moved past partying as a whole, I think everyone would benefit. That’s what I’m here for. That’s why I wrote this article and have the guts to share my position. I want to be the change. I want to show people the life they could have beyond this vile habit.

We need to be proactive about this, because the situation hasn’t gotten any better since it started.

I leave you with this poem.

*Laughter rings clear without shadow’s hold,*  
*Yet mirrors blur where true faces unfold.*

*It lingers and pulls where trust used to be,*  
*A hollow exchange for what’s meant to feel free.*

*In light, we rise, unbound by the haze—*  
*Keeping joy as it is, unbroken, unfazed.*
