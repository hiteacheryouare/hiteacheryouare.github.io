# Travel the world, without harming the world.

**SmartCarbon** is a web app that helps prospective travelers be more mindful of their carbon footprint. It uses user input information to run against a dynamically generated algorithm to calculate the estimated carbon footprint of their travel plans.

**How it works:**

1. The user inputs information about their travel plans, such as the mode of transportation they will use, the distance they will travel, and the number of people in their party.
2. The app uses this information to calculate the estimated carbon footprint of the trip.
3. The app then displays the estimated carbon footprint to the user.
4. The app also provides the user with information on how to reduce their carbon footprint.

**SmartCarbon uses a variety of technologies to power its functionality, including:**

* **Next.js:** A React framework that enables developers to build full-stack web applications.
* **React:** A library for building user interfaces.
* **Bootstrap:** A CSS framework that provides a collection of pre-built components and styling utilities.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that allows users to create applications faster and easier.
* **TypeScript:** A programming language that adds static typing with optional type annotations to JavaScript.

**SmartCarbon is a valuable tool for travelers who want to be more mindful of their carbon footprint. It provides users with a way to calculate the estimated carbon footprint of their travel plans and learn how to reduce their impact.**
