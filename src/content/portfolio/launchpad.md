# Take your marketing to the moon!

I built a website called launchpad, a link-in-bio card generator that lets you create and share your own custom landing page with multiple links, without using a database. Launchpad is ideal for anyone who wants to have a simple and elegant online presence, such as freelancers, influencers, artists, entrepreneurs, and more.

I used Next.js, a React framework that enables hybrid static and server rendering, as well as features such as image optimization, routing, and API routes. I also used Tailwind and Bootstrap, two popular CSS frameworks that provide utility classes and components for styling and layout. I deployed the website on Vercel, a platform that specializes in hosting Next.js applications and offers features such as serverless functions, analytics, and previews.

The website has a minimalist and modern design, with a dark theme and a rocket icon that I designed using an artificial intelligence model. The website is responsive and works on different screen sizes and devices. The website also has a fast loading speed and a high score on web performance metrics.

The website can be accessed at https://launchpadapp.vercel.app.
