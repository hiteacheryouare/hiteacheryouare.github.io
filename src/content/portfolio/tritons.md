# Tritons <u>rule the sea.</u>

I created a website for the Deerwood Tritons Swim Team, a local swimming club that offers training and coaching for all levels of swimmers. The website showcases the team’s achievements, events, news, and photos, as well as provides information for prospective members and sponsors. The website also features a contact form, a newsletter subscription, as well as a way to sign up for the team.

I used Astro, a new framework for building fast and modern websites with any frontend framework. Astro lets you use React, Svelte, Tailwind, Bootstrap, and other popular web technologies without sacrificing performance or SEO. I also deployed the website on Netlify, a cloud platform that offers hosting, serverless functions, and continuous deployment.

The website has a simple and elegant design, with a blue and white color scheme that matches the team’s logo. The logo is an angry seahorse that I designed using an artificial intelligence model. The website is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes and devices. The website also has a fast loading speed and a high score on web performance metrics.

The website can be accessed at https://tritonswim.net/.
