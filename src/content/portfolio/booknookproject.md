The Book Nook Project is a mission to empower underprivileged children with books, founded by Jamie Dunn. They partner with organizations such as LUCY Outreach, Mighty Writers, Osborn Family Health Center, Providence House, Women Against Abuse, Cradles to Crayons, Angels Outreach, and the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office to provide books in various forms. The project was inspired by Andrea Elliott's book, 'Invisible Child', highlighting the impact of reading on Dunn's life and her desire to help children in impoverished areas.

The site is built with Astro, primarily using HTML with TailwindCSS and parts of Bootstrap.
