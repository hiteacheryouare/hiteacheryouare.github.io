# AWS Code Whisperer: a Game Changer in the AI arms race against Microsoft and Copilot

If you are a developer, you know how tedious and time-consuming it can be to write code from scratch. You have to think of the logic, the syntax, the edge cases, the documentation, and the testing. You have to deal with bugs, errors, and compatibility issues. You have to keep up with the latest trends and best practices in your field. And you have to do all this while meeting deadlines, budgets, and client expectations.

Wouldn't it be nice if you had a smart assistant that could help you with all these tasks? A tool that could understand your intent, generate high-quality code for you, suggest improvements, and even teach you new skills along the way? A tool that could make coding fun, easy, and fast?

Well, that tool is here. Meet AWS Code Whisperer, the latest innovation from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that is set to revolutionize the software development industry. AWS Code Whisperer is an AI-powered code generation and completion tool that leverages the power of AWS cloud computing and machine learning to provide you with a seamless coding experience.

AWS Code Whisperer is not just another code editor or IDE. It is a game changer in the AI arms race against Microsoft and Copilot. Copilot is a similar tool that Microsoft launched last year in collaboration with OpenAI, a research organization co-founded by Elon Musk. Copilot claims to be able to generate code for any language and framework based on natural language comments or existing code snippets. However, Copilot has several limitations and drawbacks that make it inferior to AWS Code Whisperer.

First of all, Copilot relies on a pre-trained model called Codex, which was trained on billions of lines of public code from GitHub. This means that Copilot can only generate code that is already available online, and cannot handle novel or complex scenarios. Copilot also has no way of verifying the quality or correctness of the generated code, and often produces buggy or insecure code that can cause serious problems for developers and users. Copilot also has no integration with AWS services or other cloud platforms, which limits its functionality and scalability.

AWS Code Whisperer, on the other hand, uses a custom-built model called WhisperNet, which was trained on both public and private code from AWS customers and partners. This means that AWS Code Whisperer can generate code that is not only original and diverse, but also tailored to your specific needs and preferences. AWS Code Whisperer also has a built-in quality assurance system that checks the generated code for errors, vulnerabilities, performance issues, and compliance standards. AWS Code Whisperer also has a seamless integration with AWS services and other cloud platforms, which enables you to deploy your code with ease and confidence.

But that's not all. AWS Code Whisperer also has some unique features that make it stand out from any other code generation tool in the market. For example:

- AWS Code Whisperer can run security checks on your code to check for security vulnerabilites you wouldnt be able to catch
- AWS CW can cite where it got the code snippet from, and help you properly use the license

As you can see, AWS Code Whisperer is a versatile and powerful tool that can help developers get trivial stuff done _**blazingly fast**_
