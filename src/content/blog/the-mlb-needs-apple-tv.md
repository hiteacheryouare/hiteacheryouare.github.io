Most people hate that Friday Night Baseball is now exclusively on Apple TV+. I see it as necessary.


> Yes, I know. Two baseball realted articles in a row. I am aware. But, it's opening week and I can't help myself. There's just so many thoughts I've cooked up over the break that I simply must share.

Let me explain my ideaology here:

## Production Value

The production value that Apple brings to their Friday Night Baseball[^1] is absolutely unmatched. Between the visuals, the statistics, and even the scoreboard overlay, Apple brings their own UI style to the TV screen. It's just as beautiful as their UIs are.

## Implications

You see, most MLB games these days are broadcast over hyper-local television stations, and theres nothing wrong with that. I dont want to see an LA Angels game when I live near Philadelphia. I'm not sayign every game should be broadcast nationally.

What I am saying is that Apple set a new bar for what a national broadcast of a spoting event should look like. It should have the quality and production value that Apple creates for their Friday Night Baseball series. 

It's almost like a necessary evil. These games are locked away behind an Apple TV+ paywall, but these broadcasts show what truly can be done for a national sporting broadcast. As a result, the traditional national broadcasts are forced to play catchup


## Conclusion

So, in conclusion, Apple TV is doing the good work by forcing the industry forward through Friday Night Baseball. 

On a more personal note, I'm going to a Phillies game on Friday. It's not scheduled as a Friday Night Baseball exclusive, but i'll play the intro on my phone before the game.

I'll leave it here.
