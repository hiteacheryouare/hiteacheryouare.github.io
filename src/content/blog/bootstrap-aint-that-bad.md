# Bootstrap can actually be used with Tailwind, and Bootstrap is actually really underrated.

You might have heard of Tailwind CSS, a utility-first framework that allows you to create custom designs with low-level classes. You might also have heard of Bootstrap, a component-based framework that provides ready-made components and styles for responsive web development. But did you know that you can use both frameworks together?

In this blog post, I will show you how to combine Bootstrap and Tailwind in your projects, and why you might want to do so. I will also explain why Bootstrap is still a valuable framework in 2023, despite the popularity of Tailwind and other alternatives.

## Why Use Bootstrap and Tailwind Together?

Bootstrap and Tailwind are different frameworks that serve different purposes. Bootstrap is great for building websites quickly and consistently, with a predefined UI kit that works across browsers and devices. Tailwind is great for creating custom designs with fine-grained control over every aspect of your layout and style.

However, sometimes you might want to have the best of both worlds. You might want to use some of Bootstrap's components, such as navbar, carousel, or modal, but also customize them with Tailwind's utility classes. You might want to use Tailwind's responsive grid system, but also apply Bootstrap's typography and color schemes. You might want to use both frameworks' utilities for spacing, alignment, flexbox, and more.

By using Bootstrap and Tailwind together, you can leverage the strengths of both frameworks and create websites that are fast, responsive, and unique.

## How to Use Bootstrap and Tailwind Together?

There are different ways to use Bootstrap and Tailwind together, depending on your project setup and preferences. Here are some of the most common methods:

- Use a CDN link for Bootstrap and install Tailwind via npm or yarn. This is the easiest way to get started, as you don't need to configure any build tools or preprocessors. You just need to add a link to Bootstrap's CSS file in your HTML head, and then import Tailwind's CSS file in your main CSS file. You can then use both frameworks' classes in your HTML elements.
- Use a CDN link for both Bootstrap and Tailwind. This is similar to the previous method, but you don't need to install anything locally. You just need to add two links to your HTML head, one for Bootstrap's CSS file and one for Tailwind's CSS file. You can then use both frameworks' classes in your HTML elements.
- Use a custom build tool for both Bootstrap and Tailwind. This is the most advanced and flexible way to use both frameworks together, as you can customize them to your liking. You can use tools such as Webpack, Parcel, or Gulp to compile both frameworks' source files into a single CSS file. You can also use preprocessors such as Sass or Less to modify Bootstrap's variables and mixins, or use PostCSS plugins to extend Tailwind's functionality.

Regardless of the method you choose, you should be aware of some potential issues when using Bootstrap and Tailwind together:

- Conflicting classes: Both frameworks use some of the same class names for different purposes, such as .container, .row, .col, .text-center, .btn, etc. This can cause unexpected results or override each other's styles. To avoid this, you can either prefix one of the frameworks' classes with a custom namespace (e.g., .tw-container for Tailwind), or use a tool such as PurgeCSS to remove unused classes from your final CSS file.
- Redundant classes: Both frameworks provide some of the same utilities for common tasks, such as margin, padding, display, position, etc. This can result in unnecessary code duplication or confusion when choosing which class to use. To avoid this, you can either stick to one framework's utilities for consistency (e.g., always use Tailwind's spacing classes), or use a tool such as PurgeCSS to remove unused classes from your final CSS file.
- Performance issues: Both frameworks are quite large in size (Bootstrap is about 300 KB minified and gzipped; Tailwind is about 200 KB minified and gzipped), which can affect your website's loading speed and performance. To avoid this, you should always minify and compress your CSS files before deploying them to production. You should also use tools such as PurgeCSS or Tailwind's built-in purge option to remove unused classes from your final CSS file.

## Why Is Bootstrap Still Underrated in 2023?

Bootstrap is one of the oldest and most popular CSS frameworks in the web development world. It has been around since 2011 and has been used by millions of developers and websites worldwide. However, in recent years, Bootstrap has faced some criticism and competition from newer frameworks such as Tailwind, Bulma, Foundation, etc.

### Some of the common arguments against Bootstrap are:

- It is too bloated and heavy for modern web development.
- It is too opinionated and restrictive for custom designs.
- It is too outdated and behind the current trends and standards.

### While these arguments have some validity, they also overlook some of the advantages and benefits that Bootstrap still offers in 2023:

- It is still one of the most comprehensive and consistent UI kits available.
- It still provides excellent support for older browsers and devices.
- It still has a huge community and ecosystem of resources and extensions.

Bootstrap is not perfect by any means, but it is not obsolete either. It is still a valuable framework that can help you create websites quickly and easily with minimal effort. It is also constantly evolving and improving with new features and updates (the latest version at the time of writing is Bootstrap 5).

Bootstrap is not a one-size-fits-all solution for every web development project. It is not meant to replace other frameworks or tools that might suit your needs better. It is meant to complement them and provide you with options and choices.

> Bootstrap is not dead in 2023. It is still alive and kicking.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, I have shown you how to use Bootstrap and Tailwind together in your web development projects. I have also explained why Bootstrap is still a relevant framework in 2023 despite its critics.

I hope you have learned something new from this post and found it useful.

Happy coding!
