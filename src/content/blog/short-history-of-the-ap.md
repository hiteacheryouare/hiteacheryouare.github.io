# A very short history of the best news organization for informational, nonpartisan news in the US: the AP


## The History
The Associated Press (AP) is one of the oldest and most respected news organizations in the world. Founded in 1846, the AP has been providing accurate, impartial and comprehensive news coverage to millions of readers and viewers across the globe for more than 175 years.

The AP was born out of a need to share information among newspapers in the era of the telegraph. A group of six New York City newspapers formed a cooperative to pool their resources and dispatches from the Mexican-American War. This was the first time that news was transmitted electronically, and it revolutionized the speed and scope of journalism.

The AP soon expanded its network of members and correspondents across the country and the world. It covered major events such as the Civil War, the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the sinking of the Titanic, the World Wars, the Great Depression, the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, the Watergate scandal, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the 9/11 attacks, the Iraq War, the Arab Spring, the COVID-19 pandemic and many more.

## How it advances journalism foreward
The AP has also been at the forefront of innovation and technology in journalism. It was the first to use radio, television, satellites, digital photography, online platforms and social media to deliver news to its audiences. It has also pioneered new forms of storytelling such as data journalism, interactive graphics, podcasts and documentaries.

The AP has earned a reputation for its high standards of ethics and excellence. It has won more than 50 Pulitzer Prizes, the most prestigious award in American journalism. It has also received numerous other honors and accolades for its reporting on topics such as human rights, environmental issues, sports, entertainment and culture.


## Conclusion
The AP is not only a news organization but also a public service. It is a not-for-profit cooperative owned by its member news outlets, which range from local newspapers and broadcasters to national and international media companies. The AP's mission is to inform the world with factual, unbiased and relevant news that empowers people to make informed decisions.

The AP is more than just a source of news. It is a history of our times. It is a record of our collective experiences. It is a voice for our diverse perspectives. It is a very short history of the best news organization for informational, nonpartisan news in the US.
