## Introduction
According to Matthew J. Hornsey, a professor of Business at the University of
Queensland Australia, “For the first time in a century, incidences of some communicable
diseases—such as measles, mumps, and pertussis—are on the increase in the United States”
(Hornsey et al. 1). These diseases can easily be prevented through vaccination. Yet, in recent
years, people’s refusal to be vaccinated has become a complex and multifaceted problem with
severe consequences if left unaddressed. Among the stimulus, a theme that emerged between
FDR’s “Inaugural Address” and “Moral Courage and Intelligent Disobedience” was having the
courage to act upon your beliefs (Roosevelt) (Thomas and Chaleff ). There is an urgent need to
challenge the anti-vaccination movement instead of leaving it to pure discourse. One reason to
do so is the “intelligent disobedience” within the anti-vaccination group. These people, based on
a lack of information, believe that vaccines will cause harm, subsequently leading them to
“disobey intelligently.” Naturally, this raises the question– To what extent should pharmaceutical
companies dissuade intelligent disobedience of their vaccines by improving the information
surrounding them? Simply put, pharmaceutical companies should convince anti-vaccination
groups to accept and adopt immunization practices by refining their dissemination of vaccine
information and employing clear and concise communication methods to promote informed
decision-making and mitigate public health risks.


## Roots of Vaccine Hesitancy in Intelligent Disobedience
To understand the need for such improvement, one must first understand why people are
against such immunization practices. A primary impetus of this movement is the phenomenon of
people intelligently rejecting the recommendations of physicians and pharmaceutical companies
because they believe that their information will protect them more. According to Ted Thomas
and Ira Chaleff in the stimulus material Moral Courage and Intelligent Disobedience,
“Intelligent Disobedience requires refusing to follow orders that are either unlawful or will
produce harm” (Thomas and Chaleff 59). While Thomas and Chaleff’s idea of moral courage is
valid, this definition has limitations. A flaw of intelligent disobedience is that people will do
what they believe to be right. However, that belief is subjective based on the information given
to them; it is not always the truth. Regardless of how it is defined, intelligent disobedience
requires much of what Thomas and Chaleff call “moral courage.” It requires going against the
grain of society, its standards, and what it thinks is right. This behavior is exhibited when
Thomas and Chaleff state, “Intelligent disobedience can simply involve the professionalism to
not execute an order that would clearly have negative operational consequences. It often also
involves moral courage” (Thomas and Chaleff 62). This idea is demonstrated in real life through
the motivations of the anti-vaccination movement. There are several reasons why these people
will intelligently disobey, most of which trace back to their knowledge surrounding vaccines,
which is often based on inaccurate information, leading them to believe that it will cause them
harm. The first of these reasons are personal beliefs. According to Azhar Hussain, a Professor of
Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences at Touro University College of Pharmacy in New
York, in his peer-reviewed academic article on the anti-vaccination movement, personal beliefs,
such as historical misconceptions and scientific skepticism, are common reasons why people
refuse immunization practices (Hussain et al. 1-4). These beliefs skew people’s perceptions of
vaccines negatively and cause people to believe that vaccines may cause harm to themselves or
their children. This belief of harm stemming from vaccines is one of the reasons why people
intelligently disobey trusted authorities when it comes to vaccinations, as they believe that their
personal opinions should take precedence over that of authority. The next reason people
intelligently disobey is that they often believe alternative therapies work better. According to
Ève Dubé, a researcher at Université Laval, in her peer-reviewed academic journal article, “these
alternative medical philosophies include but are not limited to, homeopathy, Christian Science,
chiropractic hydrotherapy, and crystal healing, among others” (Dubé et al. 178). These
alternative therapies give people the impression that they are receiving better protection from
diseases than a vaccine would give, and thus, based on this impression, leads them to disobey
the science surrounding vaccines. This information demonstrates that these groups are choosing
not to vaccinate because they believe that the information available to them is better than what
the pharmaceutical companies provide, which ultimately leads them into intelligent disobedience
based on these misconceptions. Finally, psychological factors may also contribute to a person’s
intelligent disobedience against vaccines. According to Piero Bocchiaro and Adriano Zamperini,
researchers at Università degli Studi di Palermo and the University of Padova, respectively, in
their academic study on conformity, obedience, and disobedience, “In certain contexts…simple
situational factors are more powerful than personality traits in shaping human behavior”
(Bocchiaro and Zamperini 290). A result of this can directly be seen in Thomas and Chaleff’s
writings, as they explain the two controversies between Wells Fargo and Volkswagen, both of
which were driven by greed and pressure from people’s superiors, and could have been
prevented if the lower-level employees exhibited intelligent disobedience (Thomas and Chaleff
63). In the context of the anti-vaccination movement, a common motive is a belief that they are
trying to prevent what they perceive as greed and pressure from pharmaceutical companies and
the government from affecting themselves and their loved ones by intelligently disobeying their
recommendations to vaccinate. Stepping back, one common theme that unites these reasons is
the lack of quality information surrounding these vaccines. To fix this, pharmaceutical
companies must refine their information distribution practices to deter people from choosing not
to vaccinate based on faulty information.

## Improving Vaccine Information for Informed Decisions

Pharmaceutical companies should refine the dissemination of information to effectively
convey the risks and benefits associated with vaccines during the immunization process. As
previously alluded to, where information comes from regarding vaccines, and the safety and
efficacy of which, plays a significant role in a person’s decision whether or not to get vaccinated.
According to Abbey M. Jones, a doctoral student at New York University, in her report on
parents' source of information about vaccines, “parents who did not view their child’s healthcare
provider as a reliable vaccine information source were more likely to obtain vaccine information
using the Internet. Parents who were younger, more highly educated, and opposed to school
immunization requirements were more likely than their counterparts to use the Internet for
vaccine information” (Jones et al. 1). Jones furthers this point by stating, “parents who reported
using the Internet to obtain information about vaccines were less likely to agree with accepted
tenets of vaccine science, [and] less likely to agree that children need or benefit from vaccines”
(Jones et al. 5). This research shows a clear correlation between people who are intelligently
disobeying vaccines and those who source their information from frequently unreliable sources,
such as the internet. However, this does not mean that vaccine information is not readily
available. Regulatory bodies, such as the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA),
mandate that information about the safety and efficacy of vaccines are released alongside them.
According to the FDA, the requirements for these vaccines require information such as drug
name(s), dosage form, route of administration, controlled substance symbol(s), recent major
changes, warnings and precautions, adverse reactions, and drug interactions, among many other
points of important information (U.S. Food and Drug Administration 7-17). The FDA makes
sure that there is always enough accurate information about vaccines for them to be approved in
the United States; however, implementation of these requirements often falls short of what the
public needs to understand these medications fully. For instance, when examining the labeling
details of the latest Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, individuals are provided with a lengthy
9-page document before receiving the vaccine. This document consists of extensive paragraphs
containing numerous medical terms, presented in relatively small font sizes, potentially making
comprehension difficult (BioNTech et al.). Most people will neglect to read these as well,
lowering their effectiveness. In fact, according to a study conducted by Ellen W. Clayton et al.,
when parents were presented with pamphlets with information regarding the vaccine a child
would be receiving, “fewer than half (38%) read them thoroughly, and most (63%) said that they
should be distributed only on the first visit for vaccinations.” (Clayton et al. 371). To address
these shortcomings, pharmaceutical companies should take proactive steps to ensure that
information regarding vaccines, including their safety and effectiveness, is readily available and
understandable to everyone. This information should be exceptionally clear and provided to
patients during vaccination. It is also crucial that the language used is accessible and easily
comprehensible for recipients, with visuals aiding clarity. Moreover, integrating this information
into the immunization process itself, such as through informative sessions with healthcare
providers or user-friendly pamphlets, can significantly enhance understanding and
decision-making. Research has also argued for this solution. According to Jane Root and Sue
Stableford, in their peer-reviewed article on the need for easy-to-read consumer communication,
improving the readability and clarity of medical information is greatly needed because “we all
suffer from information overload. and we like necessary reading to be as quick and easy as
possible” (Root and Stableford 16). By prioritizing transparent and accessible communication,
pharmaceutical companies can empower individuals to make informed choices about
vaccination, ultimately contributing to public health efforts. Nevertheless, it is important to
acknowledge that there are limitations associated with this suggested solution. The first problem
arises when dealing with the implementation of this solution. It is unclear whether the
enforcement of this system should fall upon the physicians administering the vaccination, or the
pharmaceutical companies who produce and manufacture the vaccine. If the responsibility fell
upon the physicians, it would be unclear to the pharmaceutical companies if the patient was fully
aware of the information regarding the vaccine. If it fell upon the corporations, the physicians
could just as easily skip over informing the patient of the risks and benefits surrounding their
immunization. In addition, this proposed solution only applies in the United States, where the
scope of the research was limited. This solution has some limitations, but if implemented
correctly, it can lead to a healthier, more informed public. By prioritizing transparent and
accessible communication, pharmaceutical companies can empower individuals to make
informed choices about vaccination. When people have access to comprehensive information
about the risks and benefits of vaccines, they are better equipped to weigh their options and
make decisions aligned with their personal health goals and values. This all demonstrates how
improving information surrounding vaccines can directly improve the situation surrounding the
anti-vaccination movement.

## Counterarguments

Even if these measures were correctly implemented, counterarguments would still arise.
Most of the counterarguments surrounding improving the information surrounding vaccines
revolve around neglecting to accept information from pharmaceutical companies and obscuring
important information by abstracting it away. Often, people have already made up their minds
when deciding whether to receive a vaccine or not, and no amount of information can change
their minds. This sentiment can be seen in Ève Dubé’s article, as she states, “Simply
communicating information about vaccine safety and efficacy to those who are vaccine-hesitant
is insufficient to stem the growth of hesitancy. More information on vaccines does not
automatically result in more trust in vaccines. Worse yet, pro-vaccine messages can have
unintended and undesirable consequences such as increasing resistance to vaccination” (Dubé et
al. 184). Nevertheless, it is essential to realize that even if these holdout groups resist, more
people will be getting vaccinated, and this will always have a positive effect, as each person
protected against a disease moves the population as a whole towards less risk, as a high
vaccination rate within a population provides indirect protection to those who cannot be
vaccinated or are at higher risk of complications. In addition to the lack of receptiveness towards
vaccine information, some may believe that improving the readability of this information may
make the problem worse by inadvertently hiding critical information via abstraction. According
to Jane Root and Sue Stableford, Medicaid customers had information about their plans
delivered to their doorstep as a cartoon, with important information buried in the middle, which
was often overlooked or misconstrued (Root and Stableford 16). This does not directly apply to
vaccine information, but it shows how making the information “easier” to understand may
obscure some of the more critical details. Situations like these, however, may be averted by
striking a balance between comprehensibility and the importance of the information when
planning these new systems. Although some counterarguments may arise, improving the
dissemination of information surrounding vaccines will have a net positive impact on the public
health of the United States.
Conclusion
In conclusion, combating anti-vaccination sentiment requires an approach that addresses
the various factors contributing to this phenomenon and any counterarguments that may arise.
While pharmaceutical companies must refine their communication strategies to effectively
convey the importance of vaccination, it is essential to acknowledge the challenges and
limitations inherent in this endeavor. Nevertheless, by prioritizing public health and promoting
informed decision-making, we can strive towards a future where vaccination is embraced as a
vital tool in safeguarding global health.
