Here's why:\n\n## My Position\n\nI'm in a unique positon to speak on this topic, as I am still in school. I would consider myself a pretty high achieveing student. Here are my grades as of writing to prove it:\n\n\n| Class | Grade |\n|----------|----------|\n| AP English Language | 96% |\n| AP European History | 100% |\n| AP Chemistry | 98% |\n| AP Seminar | 100% |\n| Honors Geometry | 98% |\n| Religion III | 100% |\n| Honors Spanish III | 100% |\n\nAs you can see, I obviously do care about school, but its far from the only thing that I care about it.\n\n## Why people do it\n\nShort answer: its probably becuase of trauma. \n\nBeing surrounded with those _type A_ students pretty much my whole life, I've come to realize that we are all basically the same person. We all have pressure, either from ourselves, or from other people in our lives, at one point or another, to succeed in school. However, once this pressure stops, we never really stop pressuring ourselves. This leads to an untamable desire for good grades and academic validation. This is what leads people to making their academics their whole personality.\n\n## What do I mean by \"making it your whole personality\"?\n\nWhen I say you are making school your \"whole personality\", I am describing that thought process that won't stop worrying abou  grades, schoolwork, and in general, succeeding in school. . Some common signs of this type of thought process are:\n\n- Constantly worrying about test, grades, etc\n- Constant convern over college admission/standardized admissions tests (i.e. SAT, ACT, MCAT, BAR) \n- Trying to do as many extracurriculars as possible to stand out\n- Attemopting to be the jack of all trades\n- Never ever confident in their work\n\n## Why this isnt good\n\nSchool is mandatory. All kids do it. We all symopathize with each other over it. It's the main source of stress in any child's life. However, when you worry about it too much, it begins to suck the life out of you.\n\nHere's my stance: \n\n> School should never take precedence over the things in your life that you actually enjoy. This may include hobbies, sports, family, relationships, etc.\n\nIf you ever, **EVER** cross this line, you are doing it wrong. This is a plain and simple fact in my head. \n\nYou know, it kinda draws me back to one of my favorite TV shows of this year, [Severance](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/severance/umc.cmc.1srk2goyh2q2zdxcx605w8vtx). Basically the premise is that this company requires its workers to sever their memories between work and personal, so that one side cannot access the other during its allotted time. \n\nI try to apply this principle to my life. I try to keep my school concerns during school hours, and my personal concerns out of school time. It's simple seperation of concerns.\n\n## How we can fix\n\nThe first and most important step is to literally stop caring so much. High School is a time for living, and in my view, you can't live if you're tied up in school work. You'll end up sucking all the fun out of the most fun time in your life. \n\nIt's OK. Trust me. You're not gonna die if you get a B. Learn from your mistakes, fix it next time, and move on.\n\nThe second part to this fix is not that you've eliminated any excess concern for school, start focusing on things you like. For me, thats sports (specifially swimming), being with my friends, and coding. These things are what make me such a generally happy, upbeat, and high energy person so consistently. It's becuase I make time for these things, seperate from my school concerns.\n\n\n## TL;DR\n\nStop caring so much about school, and learn to make time for yourself to do the things you enjoy. You, and everyone around you will benefit from it.\n\n\nOr don't.\n\n_-ry_","src/content/blog/school-schould-never-be-your-whole-personality.md","45476e5596eb4151",{"html":58,"metadata":59},"\u003Cp>Recently, I’ve been pondering this thought a lot: “why do people make school their whole personality?” And it made me consider some of the reasons that people end up doing it in the first place, which led me to the conclusion to that school should never \u003Cstrong>ever\u003C/strong> be your whole personality.

Some of it might be painless, and other things might actually cause physical harm. For the past while, I've collected my thoughts on this matter and will demonstrate it through multiple examples.\n\n## Studying\nStudying is meant to be something that you _have_ to do, not something that you _want_ to do. Yes, there is something to making sure you're comfortable for a lengthy study session, but let's not go overboard with it. I hate to break it to you, but no, your camel milk matcha latte, iPad Pro with keyboard, stacks of books with neatly organized index cards, \"aesthetic\" Notion boards, and fancy library settings will **not** get you higher grades! In fact, it might actually result in lower grades because of all the time you're spending on doing all this extraneous stuff to make it **look** like you're \"lost in study\" when really, you're nothing more than stuck at the surface level.\n\n![aesthetic studying](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/cd/e0/af/cde0af3d79e12d2ae8577b35fdc5d193.jpg)\n\n### Now for a small sidetrack about the word \"aesthetic\"\n\nThe word \"aesthetic\" has lost all of its meaning and it really makes me angry. It used to be a word that was modified by an adjective like \"oh, this room has such a chill aesthetic to it.\" But in today's world, it's taken on a whole different meaning. I blame it on TikTok and their glamorization of everything, to be honest. Now, the meaning of aesthetic has changed to an adjective itself. You'll hear sentences like \"oh, my Notion board is so aesthetic.\" What does that even mean? What kind of aesthetic?\n\nIn fact, I looked up \"aesthetic studying\" on Google Images, and the image you see above came up. This is what I mean. I hate it.\n\n## Burnout\nBurnout is not something you should be aspiring for. Yes, it will become necessary sometimes to work extra hard to get something done in time, but you should be resting for an equivalent amount of time afterward to make up for it! You shouldn't be bragging to others about how you worked so hard you sacrificed your mental and physical well-being to get something done. I bet others would be more impressed when you're on vacation relaxing because you got the work done in a timely manner while they're in crunch mode trying to rush to finish it. Just a thought.\n\n## The UV Index\n\nFinally, the reason I decided to write this article. I came across one too many TikToks of women talking about how much they love their high UV indices. Little do they know (or possibly they do know) that the UV index is a rating of how intense the sun's **radiation** is. Higher UV indices mean you have a higher chance of getting **radiation poisoning** from the sun.\n\nLet's put this in a different context. Let's say we're taking a trip to Chernobyl. I'm gonna make up an index that reports how intense the radioactivity of the site is on a given day (let's call it the CH Index).\n\nI'm almost certain the same women who gush at the sight of a UV index over 7 would scream at the sight of a CH index at an equivalent level. Why the difference? Because the UV rays from the sun come with being tan. That's literally the only difference. You're still running a very high risk of radiation poisoning and skin cancer. Both of which are no joke.\n\n---\n\nSave yourself the trouble. Don't glamorize these things.

I'm a little mad right now. Do you want to know why? It's because we're treating these JavaScript `(libraries|frameworks)` like they're corperations like Apple and Samsung, both of which have amassed loyal, **cult** followings that would burn you at the stake if you showed signs of the supporting the other side on their side. But guess what, (although both React and Svelte are owned and maintained by Facebook and Vercel, respectively), these are still, at their hearts, open-source JavaScript frameworks!! They might even (_gasp_) share ideas with one another 😨😱\n\n\n## How this started\nThis started after I watched [this video](https://youtu.be/bh-e700IlmQ) by [the Primeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen), where he reads and reacts to a blog post from a svelte developer. (Hi Prime if you're reading this one). The point of the post however, was to disprove one of the main arguments for react, and against svelte, that being the ecosystem around it. The post argued that svelte doesn't have a large ecosystem because the framework itself is pretty batteries-icluded when it comes to common tasks such as state management, scoped css, transitions, etc. However, this is what got me thinking.\n\n\n## Does it really matter that much?\nShort answer: **no.**  \u003Cbr />\nLong answer: **no.** (but with more words)\n\nYou see, I would call myself both an avid React and Svelte developer. I've bult applications at scale with both of them (although React was with Next, I believe it was a vaild and neccesary abstraction), and I love the ergonmics of both libaries. For Svelte, it has quite frankly never been easier to build large scale, simply reactive, fast, \"it just works\" apps, with the magic of the Svelte compiler. However, with React, I love how close it stays to JavaScript at its core. Using ternarys to convey conditionals in the UI is exactly what my JS-brain would have thought of. Using `array.map()` to loop over an array and display it in the UI feels like the \"official JavaScript way of doing things\". React feels like an extension of JavaScript, while Svelte feels more like a all or nothing solution. And guess what, **that's totally OK!**\n\n\n## It's not the arrow, its the archer\n\nGuess what? If you can build a website with Svelte, and that feels most comfortable to you, then do it. If you can do it better in Vue, do it. If you can do it better in React, do it. If you can do it better in a obscure ARM64 assembly language designed by a russian cybercriminal who's been on the CIA's most wanted list for the past 30 years, **then do it.**\n\nMy point is that it's not the tools we use to build these amazing apps. It's the amazing developer who makes the amazing apps. If you can make your app amazing, nobody cares what you used to build it. Take [SoFi stadium](https://www.sofistadium.com/) in Los Angeles for example (pictured below). It is (in my opinion) one of the most beautiful studtures built in the modern world, and a complete engineering marvel. Notice how nobody is asking if it was built with Stanley or Black & Decker tools? Literally nobody cares what it was built with, as long as it looks good and is fuctional, you'll get the praise either way.\n\n![SoFi Stadium](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.edf274dfa51ee153059fcced1343da84?rik=UCt2EeWGQvrT1g&pid=ImgRaw&r=0)\n\n\n## Let's fix this\n\nThere is only one true way to fix this dilemma.

I've been a fan of them since I was little, and have been going to their games since I was little too. However, there was a period of time in between 2021 and 2023 where I didnt really go to any games. However, during this time, MLB quietly introduced the Ballpark app, which I believe is the gold standard for what professional sports ticketing systems should be in today's age.\n\n\nHere is a non-comprehensive list of all the things that I like about it.\n\n**_This post is not sponsored in any way. I just love the app this much._**\n\n## One account. All of baseball.\n\nOk, I'll admit that sounds like a tagline for [mlb.com](https://mlb.com) 🤪\n\nBut really, its the best. I have one MLB.com account, and any tickets for any game that I wish to attend across the whole league can be bought on that one account, and it'll show up on the Ballpark app because I'm signed into it with my MLB account. It's awesome!\n\nFor the NFL, for example, I would have to create a ticketmaster account, buy individual tickets for an Eagles game through the Eagles ticketmaster page, and then download them to my Apple Wallet (more on that later). And then if I wanted to go to any other teams game, I'd have to go through this whole process again! How inconveinient!\n\n## Ticket tracking\n\nThere's a page in the app where you can track all of your tickets for all of the games you have been to with the app. It even shows a summary of the number of stadiums and teams you've seen play!\n\n\n## Favorite teams\n\nI can check the schedule for the Phillies becuase I have them as a favorite team in the app. But, I can just as easily flip over to any other team in the MLB and see what they have going on\n\n## Stadium entry\n\nIt is by far the easiest way to get into the stadium. I just put my phone in the scanner and I'm in. That's all there is to it! \n\nDon't even get me started on Go-Ahead Entry. Super dystopian, but also the fastest way I've ever gotten into a stadium.\n\nAnd the same app works across every. single. stadium. I don't need to download an app for every team, as the Ballpark app works for all of them!\n\n\n## Apple Wallet, only if you want it\n\nThis is such a small thing, but I think that Apple Wallet is becoming a tad overused these days. Espically if you have season tickets for something like an Eagles game. Yes, I know you can clear them from your wallet but it really is an inconveinience. For Ballpark, you can choose to put them in your Apple Wallet, or just use the interface built into the app, and then have them automatically put them in your [collection](#ticket-tracking)\n\n\n## Stadium navigation\n\nThis is espcially useful if you're in a new stadium you've never been to before. This feature gives you an interactive map of the stadium to find food, restrooms, etc.\n\n## Sharing tickets\n\nGone are the days where you have to use your friend's phone to get into the stadium. Now, they can send you a ticket that gets credited to your MLB account, and that you can use by yourself to get into the stadium. It even gets added to your [collection](#ticket-tracking)\n\n\n## What I don't like\n\n- The app looks sterile and bare, but this does not impede on the fuctionality. It could just use some design tweaks\n- Sharing tickets is a bit of a janky process, both on the sending and recieveing end, and could use some polish\n- A lot of the app requies you to be in an external browser, whcih defeats the whole purpose of the app. Like, I get it if theres some niche thing you can only access on the browser, but I feel like buying tickets should at least be an in-app experience. They could even tie it in with Apple Pay.\n- This is a nitpicky request, but I would love it if they used the Live Activities API for when they recognize you are in a stadium, and give you like a countdown or something until the first picth. That would be so cool.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI love the MLB Ballpark app, and I wish other leauges would follow in the MLB's footsteps, becuase they are really onto something good here\n\nCheck it out [here](https://www.mlb.com/apps/ballpark)","src/content/blog/the-mlb-does-ticketing-right.md","c711bc174c5ab719",{"html":158,"metadata":159},"\u003Cp>I love the Phillies.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They’re my hometown team.

More programming languages. Never fear! I have concocted one from the deepest, darkest dephts of my strange sense of humor. I tried to keep it reasonable enough that it was usable, but also threw in some tricks to make it uniquely **mine**\n\nIt's called GiraffeScript, or GScript for short. It's logo is listed above\n\n## Basis\n\nLet's start of with a base language. I am most familiar with TypeScript, so we'll build off of that. Plus, the current tooling in the JS ecosystem rigeht now is beyond compare, and has some of the best suppourt around. Plus, we can use existing tools like node, deno, and V8 to execute the code after it has been transpiled. (Yes, its a superset. Put your pitchforks and torches down please)\n\n## Basics\n\nLet's start off with the basics of the language, and demonstrate them with some example programs.\n\n#### Hello, World\n`console.*` is a bad abstraction. It's meant strictly for debugging, and you have to access the `console` namespace to even display words on a screen. Not helpful nor fun for beginners. To print to the standard output, simply use `write()`\n```ts\nwrite('Hello, World!'); // Prints \"Hello, World!\" to the standard output.\n```\n\n### Delclaring Variables\n\nWhy do we need three keywords to declare a variable? I still dont know the answer to that question.\nTo declare a variable, use `var`.\n```ts\nvar name = \"GScript\"\n```\nALl variables shall be globally scoped and immutable by default. To change this behavior, change your declaration.\nTo make it mutable, add `mut`.\"\"\nTo make it block scoped, add `blockscope`\n```rs\nmut var animal = 'Giraffe' // Globally scoped mutable variable\nblockscope var short  = 'G' // Blockscoped immutable variable\nblockscope mut var lessShort = 'GScript' //blockscoped mutable variable.\n```\n\n#### Types\n\nAs with typescript, all types are optional. If you do not specify a specific type, the type will be infered. If you want to be condecending about it, you can tell the compiler to explicity infer the type, which is its automatic behavior\n```ts\nvar bestAnimal: infer = 'Giraffe'\n```\nIn fact, you can use `infer` with a generic, defeating the whole purpose of it in the first place!!\n```ts\nvar myFavoriteNumber: infer\u003Cnumber> = 6\n```\n\nTo specify the return type of the function, use the squiggly arrow. This is due to how it looks kinda funny, and that pleases me.\n```ts\nfunction getBestAnimal() ~> infer\u003Cstring> {\n    return 'Giraffe'\n}\n```\n\n## Functions\nThere are multiple different ways to declare a function. The most simple of which is `function`\n\n```ts\nfunction add(a: infer\u003Cnumber>, b: infer\u003Cnumber>) ~> number {\n    return a +b\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if you want to be concise, a hipter, or a consice hipster, you can use an arrow function!\n```ts\n-> (a, b) ~> infer\u003Cnumber> => a+b \u003C-\n// Notice how the function has to be on one line, and surronded by arrows pointing at it, to let the rest of the program know how concise and hip it is.\n```\n\nAs in typescript, you can assign these to variables\n```ts\nvar addFn = -> (a, b) => a+b \u003C-\n```\n\n### Returning Values\nTo return a value, simply use `return` \u003Cbr>\nTo do the opposite, use `retain` \u003Cbr>\nRetain keeps the value in memory, and will persist there, doing nothing, until the program is terminated. \n\n```ts\nfunction findersKeepers() {\n    retain 'cookies'\n}\n// The string 'cookies' will persist in memory until the program is terminated.\n```\n\n#### Conditional Returns\n\nYou can return values if a certian parameter is met. For example:\n\n```ts\nfunction addButSpecial(a: number, b: number) ~> infer\u003Cnumber> {\n    return a+b if (a+b > 5) else retain a+b\n}\n```\n\n### Funky Functions\n\nTo make your program even more fun, you can make your functions `funky`! `funky function`s run line by line, in a random order. How funky!\n\n```ts\nfunky function getGroovy() ~> infer {\n    blockscope var boogie = boogie()\n    blockscope var chicken = chicken()\n    blockscope var twist = twist()\n    write(boogie);\n    write(chicken);\n    write(twist);\n    return\n}\n// Expected output: ???\n```\n\nArrow functions can also be funky!\n\n```ts\nvar breakDance = -> funky () => breakdance(); askForTip(); \u003C-\n// Expected output: ???\n```\n\n### Generator Functions\n\nGenerator functions are a dark pattern and have been removed from the language. To restore this archaic feature, you must jump through hoops:\n```ts\n// This function returns the function* keyword\nfunky function jumpThroughHoops(guess: number) ~> infer {\n    return if (guess === random(1, Infinity))\n}\n```\nIf you guess correctly, the `function*` keyword becomes available\nHowever, as a punishment for using this dark pattern, all generator functions must be funky\n\n```ts\nfunky function* goToHell() ~> infer {\n    yield(void);\n    yeild(process.platform);\n    yeild(os.delete('C:/Windows/System32'));\n}\n```\n\n### Async Functions\n\nSince `async function` always returns a promise, it makes it roughly 10x harder to work with, so, you must type out the word `asynchronous` to take the extra 1/2 second to realize what you are getting yourself into. \u003Cbr>\n`await` also has a similar punishment, as you must use `anticipate`.\n\nExample async function:\n\n```ts\nasynchronous function hitAPI() {\n    blockscope var result = anticipate fetch('...')\n    return if (anticpate result.json().isLongerThan(5000)) else retain anticipate result.json()\n}\n```\n\nOf course, async functions can also be funky!\n\n```ts\nfunky asynchronous function hitAPI() {\n    blockscope var result = anticipate fetch('...')\n    return if (anticpate result.json().isLongerThan(5000)) else retain anticipate result.json()\n}\n// This might return before even hitting the API\n```\n\n\n## Arrays\n\nArrays work just like the do in TypeScript, however, there are some notable changes.\n\nIf the day of the week (local time) is Friday, arrays begin indexing at `[1]`. That way, the program always breaks on a Friday. This is to maximize job retention when using GScript. \n```ts\nvar myArray: infer\u003Cstring[]> = [\n    '0',\n    '1',\n    '2'\n]\nif (myArray[1] === '0') {\n    deleteApp()\n}\n// ^^ If this runs on a friday, the app will be deleted\n\n```\n\n\n## Loops\n\nUnlike other perfect languages named after animals, we believe in loops here. To perform a loop, there is no need to create a varible and increment it each time. Simply use `do ... times`\n\n```ts\ndo 50 times {\n    write('woohoo');\n}\n```\n\nTo get the index of where the loop is at, use `with index ...`\n\n```ts\ndo 50 times with index i {\n    write(`we are at iteration number ${i}`)\n}\n```\n\n### Loops Over Arrays\n\nTo loop over arrays, do not use `do`. Please use `each ... in ...`\n```ts\neach number in numberArray {\n    write(number)\n}\n```\n\nYou can still use `with index ...` here as well\n\n```ts\neach word in dictionary with index i {\n    write(`the ${i} word in the dictionary is ${word}`)\n}\n```\n\n## Example Programs:\n\n### FizzBuzz\n\n```ts\ndo 100 times with index i {\n    if ((i + 1) % 3 === 0 && (i + 1) % 5 === 0) {\n        write('FizzBuzz');\n    } else if ((i + 1) % 3 === 0) {\n        write('Fizz');\n    } else if ((i + 1) % 5 === 0) {\n        write('Buzz');\n    } else {\n        write(i + 1);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Fibonacci Sequence\n```ts\nblockscope var n = 10; // Specify the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate\n\nblockscope var fibArray: infer\u003Cnumber[]> = [0, 1]; // Start with the first two numbers\n\ndo (n - 2) times {\n    blockscope var len = fibArray.length;\n    blockscope var nextNum = fibArray[len - 1] + fibArray[len - 2];\n    fibArray.push(nextNum);\n}\n\neach fibNum in fibArray {\n    write(fibNum);\n}\n```\n\n## Arrays\n\n```ts\nblockscope var fruits: infer\u003Cstring[]> = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange', 'Mango', 'Pineapple'];\n\nwrite('Welcome to the fruit stand!');\nwrite('Here are the available fruits:');\n\nif (isFriday()) {\n    each fruit in fruits with index i {\n        write('[' + (i + 1) + '] ' + fruit);\n    }\n} else {\n    each fruit in fruits with index i {\n        write('[' + i + '] ' + fruit);\n    }\n}\n\nblockscope var selectedFruitIndex = 3; // Let's pretend the user selected the third fruit\n\nif (isFriday()) {\n    selectedFruitIndex++; // Adjust the index by adding 1 on Fridays\n}\n\nif (selectedFruitIndex >= 1 && selectedFruitIndex \u003C= fruits.length) {\n    var selectedFruit = fruits[selectedFruitIndex - 1];\n    write('Great choice! You selected: ' + selectedFruit);\n} else {\n    if (isFriday()) {\n        write('Oops! Invalid selection. Today is Friday, the fruit stand is closed!');\n        retain 'Backup plan initiated: Enjoy a backup fruit basket!';\n    } else {\n        write('Oops! Invalid selection. Please choose a valid fruit index.');\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n## Kitchen Sink\n```ts\nblockscope var name = 'GScript';\nvar age = 5;\nmut var counter = 0;\n\nfunction greetPerson(person: infer\u003Cstring>, isFormal: infer\u003Cboolean>) ~> infer\u003Cstring> {\n    return if (isFormal) {\n        `Hello, ${person}! Nice to meet you.`;\n    } else {\n        `Hey there, ${person}! How's it going?`;\n    }\n}\n\nfunky function funkyCounter() {\n    do 5 times {\n        counter++;\n    }\n    write('Funky counter: ' + counter);\n}\n\nfunction multiplyByTwo(num: infer\u003Cnumber>) ~> number {\n    return num * 2;\n}\n\nasynchronous function fetchData() {\n    blockscope var data = anticipate fetch('https://api.example.com/data');\n    return if (anticipate data.status === 200) else retain anticipate data.json();\n}\n\ndo 3 times with index i {\n    write('Iteration: ' + i);\n    retain 'Cookie'; // Retain the string 'Cookie' in memory\n}\n\nvar result = multiplyByTwo(7);\nwrite('Result: ' + result);\n\nblockscope var fetchedData = anticipate fetchData();\nwrite('Fetched data: ' + fetchedData);\n\nwrite(greetPerson('John', true));\nwrite(greetPerson('Jane', false));\n\nfunkyCounter();\n\n```","src/content/blog/lets-make-a-new-language.md","93db5f54e12d0821",{"html":260,"metadata":261},"\u003Cp>Do you know what the worlds needs right now?

Launchpad is ideal for anyone who wants to have a simple and elegant online presence, such as freelancers, influencers, artists, entrepreneurs, and more.\n\nI used Next.js, a React framework that enables hybrid static and server rendering, as well as features such as image optimization, routing, and API routes.

Climate change is an issue that has a significant impact on the lives of the population of the United States, as well as the country’s sustainable development goals. These consequences can lead to extensive negative effects on the security of food and water, human well-being, economies, and society, and consequential losses and harm to both nature and individuals. (IPCC 42). Since 2000 in the United States, the policies created by or proposed to the government to try to mitigate the effects of climate change have been the question of many debates, and thus, have become a complex and multifaceted issue since, naturally, there is more than one way to solve the issue. This begs the question, to what extent are policies intended to mitigate and prevent the effects of climate change effective in the United States? Simply answered, because the US’s existing climate policy relies on cooperation, both within government and between people, these policies are not effective enough at combatting the effects of climate change.\n\n# Government Cooperation and Climate Policy Ineffectiveness\nPolicies that intend to prevent climate change are ineffective because they rely on cooperation in government. According to Aaron Regunberg, a law clerk in the United States District Court of Rhode Island, in his peer-reviewed report on the Federal Reserve and its connection to US climate policy, the US is falling behind other countries when it comes to considering climate change when designing their policies and plans (Regunberg 190). This highlights the ineffectiveness because it relies on cooperation between the Federal Reserve and the executive government.  Similarly, Joseph E Aldy, a Professor of the Practice of Public Policy at Harvard, argues in his peer-reviewed report on the issues with current climate policies that most climate policies are not an end-all-be-all, and have many flaws. Some of the most prominent flaws, Aldy argues, are limited scope, high cost, and faulty plans for offsets (Aldy and Pizer 181). These flaws are due to having to compromise in the lawmaking process between multiple parties, which demonstrates how these policies can be ineffective because they rely on cooperation. Donald A. Carr, the Chair of the International Environmental Law Committee in the American Bar Association, agrees with Aldy in his peer-reviewed report on the Kyoto Climate Protocol, by stating that future climate policies will most likely also fail; however, he would also disagree with Aldy because Carr states that the lack of cooperation is due to corporations and industries (especially fossil fuel industries) and how they are not likely to accept climate policy. After all, it hurts their profitability due to increased expenses and regulations when it comes to compliance with climate policies such as the Kyoto Protocol, an international policy aimed at reducing carbon emissions (Carr and Thomas 193). Because most climate change policy in the United States relies on cooperation both within the government and the private sector, climate policy affecting the country’s sustainable development is largely ineffective.\n# Public Cooperation and Government Intervention in Climate Change Policies\nIn addition to the creation of climate change reduction policies relying on cooperation within the US government, another reason why these are often ineffective is because they rely on the cooperation of the people they affect. In his report on strategies to reduce carbon emissions, Gerald T. Gardner, a professor at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, would argue similarly to Aldy on the fact that most of the effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions rely on the diligence of individuals, such as reducing travel and reducing energy use (Gardner and Stern 16-19). These actions, when compounded with the diligence of others, can have a much more significant impact. However, not everyone will comply with them because people often don’t want to, or are unable to. Gardner concedes this in his study: \"Many households lack the funds needed to make the investments…and buyers of existing or newly built homes usually cannot choose the efficiency of heating and air-conditioning equipment and insulation.” (Gardner and Stern 23). This shows how policy fails to consider that much of what it is asking cannot be effectively carried out because it relies on collaboration, in this case, the collaboration between households to reduce their energy and transportation use. However, the IPCC, or Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in their annual report on climate change, would both agree and disagree with Gardner. They would agree that to reduce the impacts of climate change, significant cooperation between people would be necessary, but they would disagree that it is only the people that should work together, as they believe that to achieve net-zero carbon emissions, the government should create programs that physically remove carbon from the atmosphere (IPCC 85). This differs from Gardner's standpoint, as the methods IPCC suggests would require significant intervention from the government. However, this level of cooperation has not been achieved yet, and according to Carr, it likely will not in the long run. This need for cooperation between people demonstrates the ineffectiveness of current climate change policies.\n# Public Desire, Carbon Tax, and Cap-and-Trade Debates\nHowever, people still want to keep the possibility of climate change regulation open. As Erik Lachapelle, an Assistant Professor at the Université de Montréal, states in his peer-reviewed report on the public response to climate policies, an average of 70% of Americans want the government to regulate climate change in some capacity (Lachapelle et al. 345). This demonstrates how people are aware of the crisis at hand and want it to be rectified. According to Lachapelle, a carbon tax is the most popular and effective option (Lachapelle et al. 346). A carbon tax, according to Amina Chelly, an assistant professor of Industrial Engineering at the National Engineering School of Tunis, in her peer-reviewed research on carbon taxation strategies, is a policy that “aims to control emissions through taxation; that is, each industry is charged a tax that is proportional to the size of the emissions generated.” (Chelly et al. 3477). This option would most likely be the most effective because it does not rely solely on the cooperation of the American government or populace. Instead, it simply collects money from corporations in proportion to the amount of climate change they would likely be responsible for to deter them from producing more. However, Daniel Mastisoff, an assistant professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology's School of Public Policy, would likely disagree with Chelly in his research on carbon taxation policies, in favor of a “Cap and Trade” system, where organizations’ carbon emissions would be limited. If they needed more, they could trade with other organizations. Mastisoff states, “Under most circumstances, the cap and trade system is considered superior to the command and control approach because cap and trade, in theory, is more cost-effective for businesses and society. Cap and trade encourages businesses to develop more efficient technologies and allow businesses that can most cheaply reduce their emissions to do so, while businesses with high emission reduction costs do not have to reduce emissions and can instead purchase permits on the market.” (Mastisoff 12). However, both Chely and Mastisoff would likely agree that because current policy is ineffective due to the need for cooperation, future policies should place most of the work between the government and corporations. Both a carbon tax and a cap and trade system are systems that levy restrictions from the government onto organizations. This need for policy reform demonstrates how current climate policies are ineffective.\n# Conclusion\nCooperation between government branches and collaboration from individuals and industries often results in compromises limiting the efficiency of climate change policies. Addressing climate change requires reevaluation and shifting toward strategies that place more responsibility on government and corporations. Climate change policies remain largely ineffective due to heavy reliance on cooperation within the government and among the general populace; however, some solutions would prevent this from becoming an issue.\n\n\n\n\n# Works Cited\n- Aldy, Joseph E., and William A.

This differs from Gardner’s standpoint, as the methods IPCC suggests would require significant intervention from the government. However, this level of cooperation has not been achieved yet, and according to Carr, it likely will not in the long run. This need for cooperation between people demonstrates the ineffectiveness of current climate change policies.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"public-desire-carbon-tax-and-cap-and-trade-debates\">Public Desire, Carbon Tax, and Cap-and-Trade Debates\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>However, people still want to keep the possibility of climate change regulation open. As Erik Lachapelle, an Assistant Professor at the Université de Montréal, states in his peer-reviewed report on the public response to climate policies, an average of 70% of Americans want the government to regulate climate change in some capacity (Lachapelle et al. 345). This demonstrates how people are aware of the crisis at hand and want it to be rectified. According to Lachapelle, a carbon tax is the most popular and effective option (Lachapelle et al. 346). A carbon tax, according to Amina Chelly, an assistant professor of Industrial Engineering at the National Engineering School of Tunis, in her peer-reviewed research on carbon taxation strategies, is a policy that “aims to control emissions through taxation; that is, each industry is charged a tax that is proportional to the size of the emissions generated.” (Chelly et al. 3477). This option would most likely be the most effective because it does not rely solely on the cooperation of the American government or populace. Instead, it simply collects money from corporations in proportion to the amount of climate change they would likely be responsible for to deter them from producing more. However, Daniel Mastisoff, an assistant professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology’s School of Public Policy, would likely disagree with Chelly in his research on carbon taxation policies, in favor of a “Cap and Trade” system, where organizations’ carbon emissions would be limited. If they needed more, they could trade with other organizations. Mastisoff states, “Under most circumstances, the cap and trade system is considered superior to the command and control approach because cap and trade, in theory, is more cost-effective for businesses and society. Cap and trade encourages businesses to develop more efficient technologies and allow businesses that can most cheaply reduce their emissions to do so, while businesses with high emission reduction costs do not have to reduce emissions and can instead purchase permits on the market.” (Mastisoff 12). However, both Chely and Mastisoff would likely agree that because current policy is ineffective due to the need for cooperation, future policies should place most of the work between the government and corporations. Both a carbon tax and a cap and trade system are systems that levy restrictions from the government onto organizations. This need for policy reform demonstrates how current climate policies are ineffective.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Cooperation between government branches and collaboration from individuals and industries often results in compromises limiting the efficiency of climate change policies. Addressing climate change requires reevaluation and shifting toward strategies that place more responsibility on government and corporations. Climate change policies remain largely ineffective due to heavy reliance on cooperation within the government and among the general populace; however, some solutions would prevent this from becoming an issue.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"works-cited\">Works Cited\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Aldy, Joseph E., and William A.

Hornsey, a professor of Business at the University of\nQueensland Australia, “For the first time in a century, incidences of some communicable\ndiseases—such as measles, mumps, and pertussis—are on the increase in the United States”\n(Hornsey et al. 1). These diseases can easily be prevented through vaccination. Yet, in recent\nyears, people’s refusal to be vaccinated has become a complex and multifaceted problem with\nsevere consequences if left unaddressed. Among the stimulus, a theme that emerged between\nFDR’s “Inaugural Address” and “Moral Courage and Intelligent Disobedience” was having the\ncourage to act upon your beliefs (Roosevelt) (Thomas and Chaleff ). There is an urgent need to\nchallenge the anti-vaccination movement instead of leaving it to pure discourse. One reason to\ndo so is the “intelligent disobedience” within the anti-vaccination group. These people, based on\na lack of information, believe that vaccines will cause harm, subsequently leading them to\n“disobey intelligently.” Naturally, this raises the question– To what extent should pharmaceutical\ncompanies dissuade intelligent disobedience of their vaccines by improving the information\nsurrounding them? Simply put, pharmaceutical companies should convince anti-vaccination\ngroups to accept and adopt immunization practices by refining their dissemination of vaccine\ninformation and employing clear and concise communication methods to promote informed\ndecision-making and mitigate public health risks.\n\n\n## Roots of Vaccine Hesitancy in Intelligent Disobedience\nTo understand the need for such improvement, one must first understand why people are\nagainst such immunization practices. A primary impetus of this movement is the phenomenon of\npeople intelligently rejecting the recommendations of physicians and pharmaceutical companies\nbecause they believe that their information will protect them more. According to Ted Thomas\nand Ira Chaleff in the stimulus material Moral Courage and Intelligent Disobedience,\n“Intelligent Disobedience requires refusing to follow orders that are either unlawful or will\nproduce harm” (Thomas and Chaleff 59). While Thomas and Chaleff’s idea of moral courage is\nvalid, this definition has limitations. A flaw of intelligent disobedience is that people will do\nwhat they believe to be right. However, that belief is subjective based on the information given\nto them; it is not always the truth. Regardless of how it is defined, intelligent disobedience\nrequires much of what Thomas and Chaleff call “moral courage.” It requires going against the\ngrain of society, its standards, and what it thinks is right. This behavior is exhibited when\nThomas and Chaleff state, “Intelligent disobedience can simply involve the professionalism to\nnot execute an order that would clearly have negative operational consequences. It often also\ninvolves moral courage” (Thomas and Chaleff 62). This idea is demonstrated in real life through\nthe motivations of the anti-vaccination movement. There are several reasons why these people\nwill intelligently disobey, most of which trace back to their knowledge surrounding vaccines,\nwhich is often based on inaccurate information, leading them to believe that it will cause them\nharm. The first of these reasons are personal beliefs. According to Azhar Hussain, a Professor of\nPharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences at Touro University College of Pharmacy in New\nYork, in his peer-reviewed academic article on the anti-vaccination movement, personal beliefs,\nsuch as historical misconceptions and scientific skepticism, are common reasons why people\nrefuse immunization practices (Hussain et al. 1-4). These beliefs skew people’s perceptions of\nvaccines negatively and cause people to believe that vaccines may cause harm to themselves or\ntheir children. This belief of harm stemming from vaccines is one of the reasons why people\nintelligently disobey trusted authorities when it comes to vaccinations, as they believe that their\npersonal opinions should take precedence over that of authority. The next reason people\nintelligently disobey is that they often believe alternative therapies work better. According to\nÈve Dubé, a researcher at Université Laval, in her peer-reviewed academic journal article, “these\nalternative medical philosophies include but are not limited to, homeopathy, Christian Science,\nchiropractic hydrotherapy, and crystal healing, among others” (Dubé et al. 178). These\nalternative therapies give people the impression that they are receiving better protection from\ndiseases than a vaccine would give, and thus, based on this impression, leads them to disobey\nthe science surrounding vaccines. This information demonstrates that these groups are choosing\nnot to vaccinate because they believe that the information available to them is better than what\nthe pharmaceutical companies provide, which ultimately leads them into intelligent disobedience\nbased on these misconceptions. Finally, psychological factors may also contribute to a person’s\nintelligent disobedience against vaccines. According to Piero Bocchiaro and Adriano Zamperini,\nresearchers at Università degli Studi di Palermo and the University of Padova, respectively, in\ntheir academic study on conformity, obedience, and disobedience, “In certain contexts…simple\nsituational factors are more powerful than personality traits in shaping human behavior”\n(Bocchiaro and Zamperini 290). A result of this can directly be seen in Thomas and Chaleff’s\nwritings, as they explain the two controversies between Wells Fargo and Volkswagen, both of\nwhich were driven by greed and pressure from people’s superiors, and could have been\nprevented if the lower-level employees exhibited intelligent disobedience (Thomas and Chaleff\n63). In the context of the anti-vaccination movement, a common motive is a belief that they are\ntrying to prevent what they perceive as greed and pressure from pharmaceutical companies and\nthe government from affecting themselves and their loved ones by intelligently disobeying their\nrecommendations to vaccinate. Stepping back, one common theme that unites these reasons is\nthe lack of quality information surrounding these vaccines. To fix this, pharmaceutical\ncompanies must refine their information distribution practices to deter people from choosing not\nto vaccinate based on faulty information.\n\n## Improving Vaccine Information for Informed Decisions\n\nPharmaceutical companies should refine the dissemination of information to effectively\nconvey the risks and benefits associated with vaccines during the immunization process. As\npreviously alluded to, where information comes from regarding vaccines, and the safety and\nefficacy of which, plays a significant role in a person’s decision whether or not to get vaccinated.\nAccording to Abbey M. Jones, a doctoral student at New York University, in her report on\nparents' source of information about vaccines, “parents who did not view their child’s healthcare\nprovider as a reliable vaccine information source were more likely to obtain vaccine information\nusing the Internet. Parents who were younger, more highly educated, and opposed to school\nimmunization requirements were more likely than their counterparts to use the Internet for\nvaccine information” (Jones et al. 1). Jones furthers this point by stating, “parents who reported\nusing the Internet to obtain information about vaccines were less likely to agree with accepted\ntenets of vaccine science, [and] less likely to agree that children need or benefit from vaccines”\n(Jones et al. 5). This research shows a clear correlation between people who are intelligently\ndisobeying vaccines and those who source their information from frequently unreliable sources,\nsuch as the internet. However, this does not mean that vaccine information is not readily\navailable. Regulatory bodies, such as the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA),\nmandate that information about the safety and efficacy of vaccines are released alongside them.\nAccording to the FDA, the requirements for these vaccines require information such as drug\nname(s), dosage form, route of administration, controlled substance symbol(s), recent major\nchanges, warnings and precautions, adverse reactions, and drug interactions, among many other\npoints of important information (U.S. Food and Drug Administration 7-17). The FDA makes\nsure that there is always enough accurate information about vaccines for them to be approved in\nthe United States; however, implementation of these requirements often falls short of what the\npublic needs to understand these medications fully. For instance, when examining the labeling\ndetails of the latest Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, individuals are provided with a lengthy\n9-page document before receiving the vaccine. This document consists of extensive paragraphs\ncontaining numerous medical terms, presented in relatively small font sizes, potentially making\ncomprehension difficult (BioNTech et al.). Most people will neglect to read these as well,\nlowering their effectiveness. In fact, according to a study conducted by Ellen W. Clayton et al.,\nwhen parents were presented with pamphlets with information regarding the vaccine a child\nwould be receiving, “fewer than half (38%) read them thoroughly, and most (63%) said that they\nshould be distributed only on the first visit for vaccinations.” (Clayton et al. 371). To address\nthese shortcomings, pharmaceutical companies should take proactive steps to ensure that\ninformation regarding vaccines, including their safety and effectiveness, is readily available and\nunderstandable to everyone. This information should be exceptionally clear and provided to\npatients during vaccination. It is also crucial that the language used is accessible and easily\ncomprehensible for recipients, with visuals aiding clarity. Moreover, integrating this information\ninto the immunization process itself, such as through informative sessions with healthcare\nproviders or user-friendly pamphlets, can significantly enhance understanding and\ndecision-making. Research has also argued for this solution. According to Jane Root and Sue\nStableford, in their peer-reviewed article on the need for easy-to-read consumer communication,\nimproving the readability and clarity of medical information is greatly needed because “we all\nsuffer from information overload. and we like necessary reading to be as quick and easy as\npossible” (Root and Stableford 16). By prioritizing transparent and accessible communication,\npharmaceutical companies can empower individuals to make informed choices about\nvaccination, ultimately contributing to public health efforts. Nevertheless, it is important to\nacknowledge that there are limitations associated with this suggested solution. The first problem\narises when dealing with the implementation of this solution. It is unclear whether the\nenforcement of this system should fall upon the physicians administering the vaccination, or the\npharmaceutical companies who produce and manufacture the vaccine. If the responsibility fell\nupon the physicians, it would be unclear to the pharmaceutical companies if the patient was fully\naware of the information regarding the vaccine. If it fell upon the corporations, the physicians\ncould just as easily skip over informing the patient of the risks and benefits surrounding their\nimmunization. In addition, this proposed solution only applies in the United States, where the\nscope of the research was limited. This solution has some limitations, but if implemented\ncorrectly, it can lead to a healthier, more informed public. By prioritizing transparent and\naccessible communication, pharmaceutical companies can empower individuals to make\ninformed choices about vaccination. When people have access to comprehensive information\nabout the risks and benefits of vaccines, they are better equipped to weigh their options and\nmake decisions aligned with their personal health goals and values. This all demonstrates how\nimproving information surrounding vaccines can directly improve the situation surrounding the\nanti-vaccination movement.\n\n## Counterarguments\n\nEven if these measures were correctly implemented, counterarguments would still arise.\nMost of the counterarguments surrounding improving the information surrounding vaccines\nrevolve around neglecting to accept information from pharmaceutical companies and obscuring\nimportant information by abstracting it away. Often, people have already made up their minds\nwhen deciding whether to receive a vaccine or not, and no amount of information can change\ntheir minds. This sentiment can be seen in Ève Dubé’s article, as she states, “Simply\ncommunicating information about vaccine safety and efficacy to those who are vaccine-hesitant\nis insufficient to stem the growth of hesitancy. More information on vaccines does not\nautomatically result in more trust in vaccines. Worse yet, pro-vaccine messages can have\nunintended and undesirable consequences such as increasing resistance to vaccination” (Dubé et\nal. 184). Nevertheless, it is essential to realize that even if these holdout groups resist, more\npeople will be getting vaccinated, and this will always have a positive effect, as each person\nprotected against a disease moves the population as a whole towards less risk, as a high\nvaccination rate within a population provides indirect protection to those who cannot be\nvaccinated or are at higher risk of complications. In addition to the lack of receptiveness towards\nvaccine information, some may believe that improving the readability of this information may\nmake the problem worse by inadvertently hiding critical information via abstraction. According\nto Jane Root and Sue Stableford, Medicaid customers had information about their plans\ndelivered to their doorstep as a cartoon, with important information buried in the middle, which\nwas often overlooked or misconstrued (Root and Stableford 16). This does not directly apply to\nvaccine information, but it shows how making the information “easier” to understand may\nobscure some of the more critical details. Situations like these, however, may be averted by\nstriking a balance between comprehensibility and the importance of the information when\nplanning these new systems. Although some counterarguments may arise, improving the\ndissemination of information surrounding vaccines will have a net positive impact on the public\nhealth of the United States.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, combating anti-vaccination sentiment requires an approach that addresses\nthe various factors contributing to this phenomenon and any counterarguments that may arise.\nWhile pharmaceutical companies must refine their communication strategies to effectively\nconvey the importance of vaccination, it is essential to acknowledge the challenges and\nlimitations inherent in this endeavor. Nevertheless, by prioritizing public health and promoting\ninformed decision-making, we can strive towards a future where vaccination is embraced as a\nvital tool in safeguarding global health.\n\n\n## Works Cited\n\n\n- BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH, and Pfizer, Inc. “Vaccine Information Fact Sheet for\nRecipients and Caregivers about COMIRNATY (COVID-19 VACCINE, mRNA).” 8\nDecember 2022, https://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=14472.

In the context of the anti-vaccination movement, a common motive is a belief that they are\ntrying to prevent what they perceive as greed and pressure from pharmaceutical companies and\nthe government from affecting themselves and their loved ones by intelligently disobeying their\nrecommendations to vaccinate. Stepping back, one common theme that unites these reasons is\nthe lack of quality information surrounding these vaccines. To fix this, pharmaceutical\ncompanies must refine their information distribution practices to deter people from choosing not\nto vaccinate based on faulty information.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"improving-vaccine-information-for-informed-decisions\">Improving Vaccine Information for Informed Decisions\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Pharmaceutical companies should refine the dissemination of information to effectively\nconvey the risks and benefits associated with vaccines during the immunization process. As\npreviously alluded to, where information comes from regarding vaccines, and the safety and\nefficacy of which, plays a significant role in a person’s decision whether or not to get vaccinated.\nAccording to Abbey M. Jones, a doctoral student at New York University, in her report on\nparents’ source of information about vaccines, “parents who did not view their child’s healthcare\nprovider as a reliable vaccine information source were more likely to obtain vaccine information\nusing the Internet. Parents who were younger, more highly educated, and opposed to school\nimmunization requirements were more likely than their counterparts to use the Internet for\nvaccine information” (Jones et al. 1). Jones furthers this point by stating, “parents who reported\nusing the Internet to obtain information about vaccines were less likely to agree with accepted\ntenets of vaccine science, [and] less likely to agree that children need or benefit from vaccines”\n(Jones et al. 5). This research shows a clear correlation between people who are intelligently\ndisobeying vaccines and those who source their information from frequently unreliable sources,\nsuch as the internet. However, this does not mean that vaccine information is not readily\navailable. Regulatory bodies, such as the United States Food &#x26; Drug Administration (FDA),\nmandate that information about the safety and efficacy of vaccines are released alongside them.\nAccording to the FDA, the requirements for these vaccines require information such as drug\nname(s), dosage form, route of administration, controlled substance symbol(s), recent major\nchanges, warnings and precautions, adverse reactions, and drug interactions, among many other\npoints of important information (U.S. Food and Drug Administration 7-17). The FDA makes\nsure that there is always enough accurate information about vaccines for them to be approved in\nthe United States; however, implementation of these requirements often falls short of what the\npublic needs to understand these medications fully. For instance, when examining the labeling\ndetails of the latest Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, individuals are provided with a lengthy\n9-page document before receiving the vaccine. This document consists of extensive paragraphs\ncontaining numerous medical terms, presented in relatively small font sizes, potentially making\ncomprehension difficult (BioNTech et al.). Most people will neglect to read these as well,\nlowering their effectiveness. In fact, according to a study conducted by Ellen W. Clayton et al.,\nwhen parents were presented with pamphlets with information regarding the vaccine a child\nwould be receiving, “fewer than half (38%) read them thoroughly, and most (63%) said that they\nshould be distributed only on the first visit for vaccinations.” (Clayton et al. 371). To address\nthese shortcomings, pharmaceutical companies should take proactive steps to ensure that\ninformation regarding vaccines, including their safety and effectiveness, is readily available and\nunderstandable to everyone. This information should be exceptionally clear and provided to\npatients during vaccination. It is also crucial that the language used is accessible and easily\ncomprehensible for recipients, with visuals aiding clarity. Moreover, integrating this information\ninto the immunization process itself, such as through informative sessions with healthcare\nproviders or user-friendly pamphlets, can significantly enhance understanding and\ndecision-making. Research has also argued for this solution. According to Jane Root and Sue\nStableford, in their peer-reviewed article on the need for easy-to-read consumer communication,\nimproving the readability and clarity of medical information is greatly needed because “we all\nsuffer from information overload. and we like necessary reading to be as quick and easy as\npossible” (Root and Stableford 16). By prioritizing transparent and accessible communication,\npharmaceutical companies can empower individuals to make informed choices about\nvaccination, ultimately contributing to public health efforts. Nevertheless, it is important to\nacknowledge that there are limitations associated with this suggested solution. The first problem\narises when dealing with the implementation of this solution. It is unclear whether the\nenforcement of this system should fall upon the physicians administering the vaccination, or the\npharmaceutical companies who produce and manufacture the vaccine. If the responsibility fell\nupon the physicians, it would be unclear to the pharmaceutical companies if the patient was fully\naware of the information regarding the vaccine. If it fell upon the corporations, the physicians\ncould just as easily skip over informing the patient of the risks and benefits surrounding their\nimmunization. In addition, this proposed solution only applies in the United States, where the\nscope of the research was limited. This solution has some limitations, but if implemented\ncorrectly, it can lead to a healthier, more informed public. By prioritizing transparent and\naccessible communication, pharmaceutical companies can empower individuals to make\ninformed choices about vaccination. When people have access to comprehensive information\nabout the risks and benefits of vaccines, they are better equipped to weigh their options and\nmake decisions aligned with their personal health goals and values. This all demonstrates how\nimproving information surrounding vaccines can directly improve the situation surrounding the\nanti-vaccination movement.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"counterarguments\">Counterarguments\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Even if these measures were correctly implemented, counterarguments would still arise.\nMost of the counterarguments surrounding improving the information surrounding vaccines\nrevolve around neglecting to accept information from pharmaceutical companies and obscuring\nimportant information by abstracting it away. Often, people have already made up their minds\nwhen deciding whether to receive a vaccine or not, and no amount of information can change\ntheir minds. This sentiment can be seen in Ève Dubé’s article, as she states, “Simply\ncommunicating information about vaccine safety and efficacy to those who are vaccine-hesitant\nis insufficient to stem the growth of hesitancy. More information on vaccines does not\nautomatically result in more trust in vaccines. Worse yet, pro-vaccine messages can have\nunintended and undesirable consequences such as increasing resistance to vaccination” (Dubé et\nal. 184). Nevertheless, it is essential to realize that even if these holdout groups resist, more\npeople will be getting vaccinated, and this will always have a positive effect, as each person\nprotected against a disease moves the population as a whole towards less risk, as a high\nvaccination rate within a population provides indirect protection to those who cannot be\nvaccinated or are at higher risk of complications. In addition to the lack of receptiveness towards\nvaccine information, some may believe that improving the readability of this information may\nmake the problem worse by inadvertently hiding critical information via abstraction. According\nto Jane Root and Sue Stableford, Medicaid customers had information about their plans\ndelivered to their doorstep as a cartoon, with important information buried in the middle, which\nwas often overlooked or misconstrued (Root and Stableford 16). This does not directly apply to\nvaccine information, but it shows how making the information “easier” to understand may\nobscure some of the more critical details. Situations like these, however, may be averted by\nstriking a balance between comprehensibility and the importance of the information when\nplanning these new systems. Although some counterarguments may arise, improving the\ndissemination of information surrounding vaccines will have a net positive impact on the public\nhealth of the United States.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, combating anti-vaccination sentiment requires an approach that addresses\nthe various factors contributing to this phenomenon and any counterarguments that may arise.\nWhile pharmaceutical companies must refine their communication strategies to effectively\nconvey the importance of vaccination, it is essential to acknowledge the challenges and\nlimitations inherent in this endeavor. Nevertheless, by prioritizing public health and promoting\ninformed decision-making, we can strive towards a future where vaccination is embraced as a\nvital tool in safeguarding global health.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"works-cited\">Works Cited\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH, and Pfizer, Inc. “Vaccine Information Fact Sheet for\nRecipients and Caregivers about COMIRNATY (COVID-19 VACCINE, mRNA).” 8\nDecember 2022, \u003Ca href=\"https://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=14472\">https://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=14472\u003C/a>.
